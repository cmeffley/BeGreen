# It's Not Easy Being Green
Full Stack Capstone Project

### Motivation
I wanted to create a fun, simple way for someone to see if they are environmentally friendly. Then the could share ideas, meetup opportunities and practices that could help others be environmentally friendly too. Finally, they could put the ideas into practice and 'grow' something as a small reward for doing green practices. Having an animal care background and being an avid hiker, I've seen a lot of environmental changes which helped give me this idea for an application. It's pretty simple, but could helps those who want to do more for themselves and future generations. 

## Overview
This application is for a user to see how environmentally friendly they are, then share ideas with other users and put those ideas into practice.
